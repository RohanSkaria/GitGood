A bridge for aspiring developers to be more comfortable working with projects on github, An application that provides the git commands needed to join and complete  any open source project. 


## Project Plan

Title: GitGood

 - A platform where students or groups of students can post their ‘project description’ to recruit other students for their project. Students that are looking for groups to join or projects to work on, they can also go onto this platform and ‘apply’ for it.

## Goal 1: Git Hub Extension 

 - Make a better UI for accessing GitHub projects that are open source
 - Once you select a topic/resource the Application will give you the git commands to work on   the project
 - Will guide you through the git clone, git add, git commit, git push and any other commands you may need to work on it. 
 - FAQ bot which can answer questions about github and git commands


### Define problem we’re trying to solve:

 - As a CS student who needs to have experience working with real world projects, GitHub is difficult to use without having knowledge of git commands. With the use of AI, most students are capable of producing quality code but dont know how to contribute to projects on GitHub.


### Our Solution:

 - We are providing a bridge for aspiring developers to be more comfortable working with projects on github, An application that provides the git commands needed to join and complete  any open source project. 
 - Can even be an extension on your browser that can be downloaded from the google chrome store
